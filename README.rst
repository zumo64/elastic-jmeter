JMETER  Elasticsearch Tests 
-----------------------------

Performs ingestion, query , scroll and logs result on a CSV file 


### Pre-requisites

Install Jmeter 3.0
Have a ES running cluster accessible

If planning to use ingestion scripts within this package you need :
1. install npm
2. install coffeescript (see http://coffeescript.org/)


If planning to run test scan and scroll queries from Jmeter :
1. install python


### Requirements 
* the input folder contains 1..N number of bulk indexing files
* If querying enabled, there should be a query input csv (see format below)
* If scroll enabled, there should be a scroll input csv (see format below)



### ingest.bash
Use ingest.bash script to ingest sample apache logs located in ./ingest/logs.json.gz
This script will generate in ./input 20 BULK requests with 500 docs each.
tweak the parameters in the script to create more bulks



### cleanup.bash
This script cleans up all files generated by the tests


### test.bash
Run this script to launch the tests
Modify the parameters in the file as follows :

JMETER_PATH : The path of your JMeter install
USER= Shield User
PASS= Shield Pass
HOST= Target Elastic hostname/ IP address
PORT= Target Elastic port (ex : 9200)
INDEX= Indices being queried (ex: apachelogs-* )
BULK_FILES= number of files in input (ex: 21)
QUERY_CSV= the file containing queries input  (ex:input1K1h.csv)
SCROLL_CSV=the file containing scroll input   (ex:inputScroll.csv) 

QUERY_THROUGHPUT= desired query throughput per minute (ex:5.0)
INDEX_THROUGHPUT=2.0
SCROLL_THROUGHPUT=20.0

elk_stress.jmx runs in the background and takes as additional params :
  -JtestScroll=true/false   : wether we enable the scroll queries to run during the test
  -JtestIngest=true/false   :  ""  ""     ""       ingestion "" "" 
  -JtestQuery=true/false    :   ""  ""    ""        querying 


* if ingestion enabled :
JMeter will iterate the files in ./input and send the bulk queries at specified throughput

* if scroll enabled :
JMeter will iterate the scroll CSV  and send scroll queries at specified throughput  

* if query enabled :
JMeter will iterate the scroll CSV  and send queries  at specified throughput  

* if shield not use then you have to disable the authentication managers in the Jmeter test plan. not tested  with an authentication manager without shield




* Format of the query input CSV :

elk_stress.jmx comes with a query inspired from a Kibana visualization that needs a time range, so it works well with the following format:
<timestamp time1>,<timestamp time2>,<query file name> body (in ./queries) ex:
time1,time2,queryFileName
1440348513990,1440352113990,query1.json

* genDateIntervals.coffee can be used to generate random timestamp intervals.



* Feel free to add in the jmx other queries with their associated CSV input file  !



  
### the test results 
Are located in results/results.csv
the latency in ms is the csv file


### todo
improve tooling 
write all scripts in python (nodeJs not always avail)
Send the latencies directly to ES when the HTTP API
